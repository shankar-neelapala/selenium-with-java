Navigational methods
--------------------
--> Navigational methods are used to navigate between the web pages on the browser window 
--> These methods simulate user interactions with the browser's history and address bar. 
1. navigate.to()
2. navigate.back()
3. navigate.forward()
4. navigate.refresh()

1. navigate.to()
----------------
--> driver.get() and navigate.to() is functionally same. there is difference in implementation, both methods are used to launch a web page on the browser window
--> driver.get(String url)  it accepts the url in only string format
--> navigate.to(String url) or navigate.to(URL url)  it accepts the url in both string and java.net.URL Object
--> navigate.to() internally calls get() method to launch the page
syntax: driver.navigate.to(String url)
        ---> driver.navigate    returns an object of Navigational class from that we are calling to() method
Example: driver.navigate.to("https://www.google.com/")


2. navigate.back()
------------------
--> navigate.back() method is used to navigate from the current window browser to previous window browser
--> It performs same action like the backward button in the browser(left arrow - top left corner) to navigate previous window
syntax: driver.navigate.back()

3. navigate.forward()
---------------------
--> navigate.forward() method is used to navigate from the current window browser to forward, moving next page in the browser's history
--> --> It performs same action like the forward button in the browser(right arrow - top left corner) to navigate next browser window 
syntax: driver.navigate.forward();

4. navigate.refresh()
---------------------
--> This method reloads the current web page, equivalent to pressing the F5 key or clicking the "Refresh" button in the browser.
syntax: driver.navigate.refresh()

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. getWindowHandle()        --> returns an ID of singlw browser window where the driver is focused
2. getWindowHandles()       --> returns a set of strings of multiple browser windows 
These two helps to 
a. switching the driver from one window to another browser window based on window ID
b. closing specific browser window based on window ID

switching driver
----------------
--> switching driver from one browser window to another browser window
--> first we need to capture the total opening browser windows(with the help of getWindowHandle() and getWindowHandles()) on the browser then switch 
syntax: driver.switchTo.window(windowID)

closing specific browser window
-------------------------------
--> first we need to capture the total opening browser windows(with the help of getWindowHandle() and getWindowHandles()) on the browser then close
--> By using close() methods
syntax: --> capture all the windowID's the iterate through ID's 
        --> if the required browser window comes then close it by using driver.close()
