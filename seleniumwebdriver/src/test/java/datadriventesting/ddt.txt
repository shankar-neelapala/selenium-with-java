Data Driven Testing
-------------------
--> Data-Driven Testing is a type of software testing methodology or more exactly approach to the architecture
	of automated tests by creating test scripts and reading data from data files. 
 
--> Data-driven testing (sometimes abbreviated to DDT) is a software testing methodology 
	where test data is stored in external data sources like spreadsheets, databases, or CSV files,
	rather than hard coded into the test case, allowing the same test logic to be executed multiple times with different sets of data.
	
Selenium itselfg doesn't provide any interfaces or classes to read or write data from external files
we need to add external dependency to work on MS Excel file called "Apache POI"

1. open the file in read ro write mode using
	a. FileInputStream class for read data from the file
	b. FileOutputStream class for write data into the file

Excel file --> Workbook --> Sheets --> Rows --> Cells (Excel file structure)

Apache POI provides following classes to work on excel file:
1. XSSFWorkbook -- workbook
2. XSSFSheet -- sheets
3. XSSFRow -- rows
4. XSSFCell -- cells

add these following dependencies to your maven project in order to work with excel files
<!-- Apache POI Core -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>
    <artifactId>poi</artifactId>
    <version>5.2.5</version> <!-- Use the current stable version -->
</dependency>

<!-- Apache POI for Excel (.xlsx) files -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>
    <artifactId>poi-ooxml</artifactId>
    <version>5.2.5</version> <!-- Use the current stable version -->
</dependency>
