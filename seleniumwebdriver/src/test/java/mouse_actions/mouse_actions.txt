Mouse Actions
-------------
--> In Selenium, mouse actions are automated using the Actions class which provides methods to simulate low-level user interactions with web elements,
--> such as clicks, hovering, and drag-and-drop operations. 

1. mouse hover action
2. right click action
3. double click action
4. drag and drop

--> Actions class contains all the methods that are helps to perform automated mouse actions
Syntax: Actions object = new Actions(WebDriver);

Common Actions class methods
----------------------------
1. click(WebElement target): Performs a left-mouse click in the middle of the specified web element.
2. doubleClick(WebElement target): Performs a double left-mouse click on the specified element.
3. contextClick(WebElement target): Performs a right-mouse click on the specified element to open a context menu.
4. moveToElement(WebElement target): Moves the mouse pointer to the center of the specified element (useful for simulating a mouse hover to reveal hidden menus).
5. clickAndHold(WebElement target): Performs a left-mouse button press without releasing it, at the center of the specified element.
6. release(): Releases the left-mouse button that was previously pressed and held by clickAndHold().
7. dragAndDrop(WebElement source, WebElement target): Drags an element from a source location and drops it onto a target element.
8. dragAndDropBy(WebElement source, int xOffset, int yOffset): Drags an element from a source location by a specific pixel offset in the X and Y dimensions.

Example
1. mouse hover action --> moveToElement(webelement)
---------------------------------------------------
--> Actions act = new Actions(driver);
--> act.moveToElement(computers).build().perform();

2. right click action	--> contextClick(webelement)
----------------------------------------------------
--> act.contextClick(button).perform();

Note: 
--> In Actions class every action definitely end withs either ".build().perform()" or ".perform()" methods
--> without build() and perform() method it doesn't do any action on the page
--> build() method is used to build/create an action
--> perform() method is used to perform an action
--> we can use perform() along with build() method or directly we can use perform() method
--> perform() method is capable of building/creating an action and performing an action

purpose of build() method?
--------------------------
--> it is used to build an action
--> in some situations we need to build the action at first and perform action later. in this type of situations build method is required
--> we need store the builded/created action to perform an action later, hence there is a class to store an action called "Action"

Action
------
--> used to store an action builded by build() method
syntax: Action object = Actions_object.mouseActionMethods.build();
		object.perform();
Example:
--> Action myact = act.moveToElement(desktops).click().build();
--> myact.perform();
