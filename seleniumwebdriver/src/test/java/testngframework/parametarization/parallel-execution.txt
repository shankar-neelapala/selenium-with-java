Parallel Execution
------------------
--> Parallel execution in TestNG means running multiple test methods / classes / tests at the same time instead of one after another.
--> The main goal is to reduce total execution time by using multiple threads.
--> TestNG achieves this using multithreading, and it’s configured mainly through the testng.xml file.

Why use parallel execution?
1. Faster test execution
2. Efficient use of CPU resources
3. Useful for large regression suites
4. Very common in Selenium automation

TestNG creates multiple threads, and each thread runs tests independently based on your configuration.
You control: 1.What runs in parallel, 2.How many threads are used

Parallel execution modes
------------------------
1. parallel="methods"
	Runs test methods in parallel
	Methods can be from the same or different classes
	Each @Test method runs in a separate thread

2. parallel="classes"
	Runs test classes in parallel
	Methods inside a class run sequentially
	Good balance of speed and stability
	
3. parallel="tests"
	Runs <test> tags in parallel
	Very popular for cross-browser testing
	
thread-count="5" (2-5)
---------------
--> Maximum number of threads TestNG can create
--> More threads ≠ always faster (depends on CPU & test design)
