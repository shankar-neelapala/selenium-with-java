Assert 
------
--> In TestNG, the Assert class is used to verify whether a test’s actual result matches the expected result.
--> It decides pass or fail for your test case.

We use assertion for validaion. General validtion like if-else statements does not validate the test
Example:
	if("Ronaldo".equals("Messi"){
		sysout("fail");}
	it is failed but the test is passed we are printing the value that is failed, the test method return  test is passed
so we need Assert class for test case validation
Example:
	Assert.assertEquals("Ronaldo","Messi");
	test is failed
	
Two types of assertions
-----------------------
1. hard assertion
2. soft assertion

1. Hard Assertion
-----------------
--> We can access from "Assert" class
--> Methods are static
--> If the assertion is failed then remaining statement will not be executed
--> Used when a failure is critical and further steps make no sense
Example:
	@Test
	public void hardAssertExample() {
	    System.out.println("Step 1");
	    Assert.assertEquals(10, 20);   //fails here
	    System.out.println("Step 2");  //never executes
	}

2. Soft Assertion
-----------------
--> We can access from "SoftAssert" class object
--> If the assertion is failed then still the remaining statements will execute
--> Used when you want to validate multiple conditions in one test
--> All failures are reported together at the end
Example:
	@Test
	public void softAssertExample() {
	    SoftAssert softAssert = new SoftAssert();
	
	    System.out.println("Step 1");
	    softAssert.assertEquals(10, 20);   //failure recorded
	
	    System.out.println("Step 2");
	    softAssert.assertTrue(false);      //another failure
	
	    softAssert.assertAll();             //mandatory
	}
	
--> If you forget assertAll() --> test will PASS even with failures
