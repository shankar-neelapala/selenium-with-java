TestNG
-------
--> TestNG ("Test Next Generation") is an open-source, powerful testing framework for Java, 
	designed to simplify a broad range of testing needs, including unit, functional, and end-to-end testing
	
1. Annotations: Simplifies coding with annotations (e.g., @Test, @BeforeMethod, @AfterClass).
2. Data-Driven Testing: Uses @DataProvider to pass multiple sets of data to a single test method.

Advantages
----------
1. Test suites and Test cases
	TestNG uses a testng.xml file to organize multiple test cases into a single test suite. This allows you to manage large collections of tests centrally, 
	choosing which ones to run or skip without modifying the actual code.
2. Grouping of test cases
	You can assign tests to specific categories (e.g., "smoke", "regression", "sanity") using the groups attribute.
3. Prioritize
	By using the priority attribute in the @Test annotation, you can control the exact sequence in which your tests run
4. Parametarized
	TestNG supports data-driven testing, allowing you to run the same test method multiple times with different sets of data.
5. Parallel testing
	You can execute multiple tests simultaneously in different threads
6. Reports
	Unlike basic frameworks, TestNG automatically generates detailed HTML and XML reports. 
	These reports clearly show the number of passed, failed, and skipped tests, along with execution times and error logs for easier debuggin
	
TestNG Configuration
--------------------
1. Install TestNG for eclipse plugin through eclipse marketplace
2. add TestNG library to the project or add TestNG dependency in pom.xml file


@Test annotation
----------------
--> @Test annotation initiates the execution of test cases
--> write this annotation above the method signature
--> we write multiple methods for a test case (eg:each method is for one step)
1. TestNG execute tests based on the alphabetical order
2. @Test(priority=number) controls the order of execution based on priority
3. Once you provided priority to the methods then order of methods is not considered
4. priorities can be random numbers(Not neccessary to have consecutive numbers)
5. If you don't provide any priority then defualt value is 0
6. If priorities are same then execution again works based on alphabetical order
7. Priority can be a negative number also
