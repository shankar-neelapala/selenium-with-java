DOM - document object model
---------------------------
The Document Object Model (DOM) is how a web browser represents a web page so that programs (mostly JavaScript) can interact with it.

Think of it like this 🌳 tree

When a browser loads an HTML document, it turns that document into a tree structure.
Each part of the page becomes a node in that tree.

Example: sample html code
	<html>
	  <body>
		<h1>Hello</h1>
		<p>Welcome</p>
	  </body>
	</html>
DOM tree version:
	Document
	 └── html
		 └── body
			 ├── h1
			 │   └── "Hello"
			 └── p
				 └── "Welcome"
What the DOM actually is
1. A programming interface for HTML and XML documents
2. A live representation of the page in memory
3. Made up of objects, not just text

Each HTML element becomes an object you can:
--> Read
--> Change
--> Add to
--> Remove
--> Listen to for events

"The DOM is the browser’s in-memory, tree-like model of a web page that allows JavaScript to read and modify the page dynamically."
The DOM is what lets JavaScript do things like:
1. Change text or HTML
2. Update styles
3. React to user actions (clicks, typing, scrolling)
4. Create dynamic content
Example:
	document.querySelector("h1").textContent = "Hi there!";
	--> Access the DOM
	--> find h1 tag
	--> change the text
	
Shadow DOM
----------
Shadow DOM is a way to create isolated, encapsulated DOM trees inside elements, protecting their structure and styles from the rest of the page.
It lets developers:
1. Encapsulate HTML, CSS, and behavior
2. Prevent styles and structure from leaking in or out
3. Build reusable, self-contained components
"DOM inside another DOM"
The #shadow-root is the Shadow DOM.

1. Shadow Host: The regular DOM node that the shadow DOM is attached to.
2. Shadow Root: The root node of the shadow tree. 
3. Shadow Tree: The hidden DOM tree inside the shadow DOM.
4. Shadow Boundary: The invisible line where the shadow DOM ends and the regular (light) DOM begins.

you can automate Shadow DOM elements, but not exactly like normal DOM
Example: 
	<my-component>
	  #shadow-root
		<button>Click</button>
	</my-component>
	if you try to click the button then the browser blocks direct traversal into #shadow-root.
	if you want to access shadow DOM elements then you must explicitly enter the shadow root.
steps to access the shadow DOM elements
1. You must get the shadow host first,
2. then access its shadowRoot, 
3. then locate the element and perform action
There may be nested shadow DOM's also

--> we cannot use xpaths here to identify the elements in the shadow DOM
	(if you try then you got NoSuchElementException)
--> Only we can use CSS Selector to identify the shadow DOM elements

By using selectorshub we got the code direclty to identify the element
Alert given by selectorshub when we are trying to identify shadow DOM elements
	This element is inside shadow dom which can't be accessed through XPath, use cssSelector
Example:
	//This Element is inside single shadow DOM.
	//String cssSelectorForHost1 = "#shadow-root";
	SearchContext shadow = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#shadow-root")).getShadowRoot();
	Thread.sleep(1000);
	shadow.findElement(By.cssSelector("#shadow-element"));
	
--> 1. get the shadow root by using getShadowRoot() method which returns the SearchContext object
--> 2. from that object we perform actions on shadow-root elements
