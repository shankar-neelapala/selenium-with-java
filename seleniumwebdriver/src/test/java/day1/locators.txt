Locators
--------

1. Locators are used to identify the elements on the webpage.
2. Locators are addressed that identify a web element uniquely within the page.

Locators:
--------
1. id
2. name
3. linktext
4. partiallinktext
5. classname
6. tagname

Customized Locators:
------------------
a. CSS Selectors
    1. tag id
    2. tag class
    3. tag attribute
    4. tag class attribute
b. XPath 
    1. Absolute XPath
    2. Relative XPath


Traditional Locators:
-->These locators identify elements based on their attributes or position in the DOM structure. 

Syntax to an element on the page:
    WebElement element = driver_object.findElement(locator);// return single web element
    List<WebElement> elements = driver_object.findElements(locator);//return group of elements

1. id
--> The most reliable and fastest locator, as IDs are intended to be unique for each element on a page.
--> Example: driver.findElement(By.id("username"));

2. name
--> Used to locate elements by their name attribute, commonly found in form elements like input fields and radio buttons.
--> Example: driver.findElement(By.name("search-query"));

3. linktext
--> Used to find hyperlinks (<a> tags) based on their exact, visible text.
--> Example: driver.findElement(By.linkText("About me")).click();

4. partiallinktext
--> Locates hyperlinks by matching a portion of their visible text. This is helpful when the link text is very long or dynamic.
--> driver.findElement(By.partialLinkText("About")).click();

The above four locators return single web element. i.e, these web elements are used to locate a single web element.



5. classname
--> Locates elements that share a common CSS class attribute.
--> Example: List<WebElement> total = driver.findElements(By.className("link-cls"));

6. tagname
--> Finds elements based on their HTML tag (e.g., div, a, input). This is useful for finding all elements of a specific type.
--> Example: List<WebElement> links = driver.findElements(By.tagName("a"));

The above two locators are used to find a specific group of web elements on the webpage

Note:
1. By is a pre defined class in java
2. It contains pre defined methods like id(), name(), className(), linkText() etc. 

If locator is not matched with any web element then,
1. findElement() throws NoSuchElement exception.
2. findElements() does not throw any exception but list size is "0".


Only two things plays in selenium
1. How to find an element.
2. What are the actions to be performed on that web element.
