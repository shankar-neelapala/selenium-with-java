Selenium with java
------------------

What is Selenium?
1. It is widely used open source framework.
2. Selenium is a web based automation tool used to test the web based application across different browsers
(chrome, firefox, edge) and different operating systems like Windows, Linux, Mac.

Three main components of Selenium:
1. Selenium WebDriver
2. IDE
3. Grid

What is Selenium WebDriver?
1. Selenium WebDriver is one of the component in Selenium
2. WebDriver is a java interface
3. WebDriver is an API

WebDriver(interface) --> RemoteWebDriver(class) --> ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, EdgeDriver(classes)

WebDriver is an API:
    Here java application and browsers are two different programs these two are communicate with the help of 
    WebDriver. Hence it acts as an API between java application and browser.

    Java application       <---->         WebDriver       <---->     Browsers
    (Eclipse, Intellij)                  (interface)                 (chrome, firefox, Linux)


Based on which browser you are going to automate the testing then respecive object for that browser is created.
let's say if you are testing your web application on chrome then create an object for ChromeDriver.


Environment setup
-----------------

--> Create a java project(Eclipse or Intellij).
--> Download WebDriver jar files and extract it.
--> Add jars in java project.

2. Creating a maven project
--> Create a maven project
--> Open pom.xml file.
--> Inside dependencies section add Selenium WebDriver dependency
1. Go to official page https://mvnrepository.com/
2. search for Selenium and select version and copy the dependency
3. Update the maven project to install Selenium WebDriver dependencies.


For testing purpose use:
src/test/java
