These predefined methods are used to interact with browser and web elements to automate the test.

General category of methods:
----------------------------

1. get methods                  --> These methods control the behavior of the entire browser window
2. conditional methods
3. browser methods
4. navigate methods
5. wait methods

1. get methods  --> we can access these through WebDriver instance
------------------------------------------------------------------
a. void get(String url)             --> This method is used to launch the web page on the browser
b. String getTitle()                --> It returns the title of the current web page
c. String getCurrentUrl()           --> It returns the current page url
d. String getWindowHandle()         --> It returns the ID of the single browser window(tab)
e. Set<String> getWindowHandles     --> It returns the ID's of multiple browser windows
f. String getClass()                --> It returns the type of the instance

getWindowHandle() and getWindowHandles() are two methods and they return browser window ID's.
with this ID's we will perform actions on the window like close or quit the window based on window ID.
Scenario:   There are multiple browser windows are opened and you want to close one particular window. 
            This is possible by using these two methods.

2. conditional methods  --> we can access these through WebElement 
------------------------------------------------------------------
a. isDisplayed()            --> It is used to check an element is displayed or not in the web page
b. isEnabled()              --> It is used to check an element is enabled or not in the web page
                                (like input boxes, search boxes if they are anabled then only we enter some data)
c. isSelected()             --> Used to check elements like radio buttons, check boxes, drop-down are selected or not


WebElement methods:
------------------
These methods interact with specific elements (like buttons, text fields, links, etc.) found on a web page using methods 
like findElement() and findElements(). 

1. click(): C                   --> licks on the element.
2. sendKeys(String value):      --> Enters text into a text entry field or sends keyboard events.
3. clear():                     --> Clears the content of a text entry field.
4. submit():                    --> Submits a form.
5. getText():                   --> Gets the visible text of the element.
6. getAttribute(String name):   --> Gets the value of a specified attribute of the element (e.g., "href" for a link).


3. browser methods  --> These method help to control the browser window
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

a. close()          --> close the current browser window where the driver is focused
b. quit()           --> quits the driver and close all the browser window associated with it
