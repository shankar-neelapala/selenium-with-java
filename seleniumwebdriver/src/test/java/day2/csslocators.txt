CSS Locators
------------
A powerful and fast method that uses CSS expressions to target elements based on their attributes, position, and hierarchy.

CSS Locators:
1. tag id                   tag#id
2. tag class                tag.class
3. tag attribute            tag[property='value']
4. tag class attribute      tag.class[property='value']

Syntax: driver_object.findElement(By.cssSelector(locator));


1. tag id   (tag#id)
--> Used to locate an element based on the tag name and id 
--> Example: driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input#small-searchterms"))
Here, "input" is a tag and "#small-searchterms" is an id.
Tag is optional here.

2. tag class    (tag.class)
--> Used to locate an element based on the tag name and class 
--> Example: driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input.search-box-text"))
Here, "input" is a tag and ".search-box-text" is a class

3. tag attribute    (tag[property='value'])     attribute has two things(property and value)
--> Used to locate an element based on the tag and attributes within the tag

<form action="/search" method="get" role="search">
    <label for="site-search">Search the site:</label>
    <input type="search" id="site-search" name="q" placeholder="Enter search terms...">
    <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>

In the above html code, look at input tag and its attribute like placeholder. So based on tag and attributes
also we can locate web elements.

--> Example: driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input[placeholder='Enter search terms...']"))

4. tag class attribute
--> Used to locate based on the tag, class and attribute.
--> Why we need this? Because if try to locate an element based on tag and class there is a chance of getting group
    of elements(same tag and same class may exist sometimes). Hence by using attribute we can differentiate them
    and locate individually each element
--> Example: driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input.search-box-text[placeholder='Search store']"))
Tag is optional.
