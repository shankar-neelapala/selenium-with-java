We have ChromeOptions, EdgeOptions, FirefoxOptions etc classes used t
--> The ChromeOptions class in Selenium WebDriver is used to customize and control the behavior, settings, and capabilities of the Google Chrome browser session during automated tests. 
--> It allows users to tailor the browser's configuration to meet specific testing requirements, which is crucial for flexible and efficient test automation. 

Key Uses and Functionality
--------------------------
1. Headless Mode: Run the browser without a graphical user interface (GUI), which is useful for continuous integration (CI/CD) pipelines and server environments where a visible UI is unnecessary.
2. Browser Behavior Control: Customize how the browser starts and operates. Common examples include:
   --> Maximizing the window on startup (--start-maximized).
   --> Running in incognito mode (--incognito) to ensure a clean session without stored cookies or history.
   --> Disabling notifications, pop-ups, and infobars (--disable-notifications, --disable-popup-blocking, --disable-infobars) that might interfere with test execution.
   --> Ignoring SSL certificate errors (--ignore-certificate-errors or setAcceptInsecureCerts(true)) for testing sites with self-signed or invalid certificates.
3. Managing Extensions and Profiles: Load specific extensions or use custom user profiles for persistent data like cookies and history.
   --> Add extensions: options.addExtensions(new File("/path/to/extension.crx"))
   --> Use a custom profile: --user-data-dir=/path/to/your/custom/profile
4. Enhancing Performance and Stability: Improve test execution performance by disabling unnecessary features.
   --> Disable GPU hardware acceleration (often needed in certain VM or Docker environments): --disable-gpu
   --> Disable extensions: --disable-extensions
5. Configuring Network Behavior: Set up proxy servers or bypass proxy settings.
   --> Set a proxy server: --proxy-server=http://my-proxy.com:8080

Advantages
----------
1. we can do multiple task(since execution happend backend
2. increase performance(faster execution)

disadvantages
-------------
1. we cannot see the actions on the page. so user cannot understand flow/functionality of the flow in the begining.


1 Headless Mode testing
--> ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
	options.addArguments("--headless=new");
	
2. Accept SSL
--> ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
	options.setAcceptInsecureCerts(true); or --ignore-certificate-errors

3. Romeve Chrome is being controlled by automated test software info bar
--> options.setExperimentalOption("excludeSwitches", new String[] {"enable-automation"});

4. run test case in incognito mode
--> ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
	options.addArguments("--incognito");
	
5. add extensions at run time
--> By default there are no extensions
steps:
1. get CRX file for any extension you want
2. pass CRX file path in automation script in chrome options

How to get CRX  file?
--> first add CRX extractor/downloader to chrome
--> then go to required extension right click then download extension as CRX file
